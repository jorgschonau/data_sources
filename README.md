# Data Sources
A collection of useful data sources, I would like to keep this one rather short. I'll also try to include more EU centred data sources. There are already some fairly exhaustive lists of data source around, this one for example:

 The US Government pledged last year to make all government data available freely online. This site is the first stage and acts as a portal to all sorts of amazing information on everything from climate to crime.
US Census Bureau http://www.census.gov/data.html A wealth of information on the lives of US citizens covering population data, geographic data and education.

Socrata is another interesting place to explore government-related data, with some visualisation tools built-in.
